        <p>Greetings! My name is Mahmood Khalil ALSaqqa and here's a brief paragraph about myself :</p>
        <P class="P-edit">I'm an 18 years old student, who is currently studying Computer Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, while also learning other things outside the University such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,other programming languages,computer hardware..etc.</p>
            <h3 class="h3-class"> Skills: </h3>

                <li>I have strong English conversational and comprehension skills.</li>

            <h4 class="h4-class">Why am i applying for this program?</h4>
            <p class="P-edit">By applying to the CodeAcademy I'm hoping to improve my programming skills, problem solving skills, my social skills and more, I'm also hoping to meet like-minded people, I will also get the chance to get first-hand exposure in the working field, I'm also sure the time i will spend at the Academy will broaden my overall skills, being surrounded by an enviroment different than the one we experience on a daily basis will definitely set me on the right path giving me the opportunity to explore more and better ways to problem solving and thus help me grow as a stronger member of society as well as helping me grow as a young professional individual.</p>
